/**
 * Mirror any website in Internet (Web) Archive
 * (read more: https://archive.org/about/)
 * 
 * THIS CLASS INTEND TO BE AN USAGE EXAMPLE!
 * 
 * Basically Internet Archive is a "museum" of
 * the internet, since it's early days.
 * 
 * It crawls the web indexing websites in different
 * times and saves mirrors that you may see whenever
 * you want. The interesting point is that you can
 * tell then which site they need to index and when.
 * That's what we do, but since their API doens't let
 * us save a mirror, I've decided to create this simple
 * code to create our mirror and return it in JSON format.
